% Question 1 (a)
A = rmat(3, 5), rank(A(:,1:3))
% If the rank is less than 3, generate a new A
b = rvect(3), R = rref([A b])
S = R(:,1:5)
S = rref(A);
% (i)
% Columns 1,2, & 3 are pivot columns
% (ii) 
% Rank of R & A is 3
% (iii)
% A has a nullity of 2, x4,x5 are free variables
% (iv)
% Because the matrix is consistent (no zero row).
% Question 1 (b)
c = R(:,6)
x = [c; 0; 0]
% Question 1 (b) i
A*x - b
S*x - c
% Question 1 (b) ii
% The Corollary from Theorem 2.3 on page 127 states: "...Ax=b has the same solutions as
% Rx=c, where [R c] is the reduced row echelon form of the augmented matrix
% [A b]." (Lawrence 127)
% We found A,S,x,c,b and Ax = b implies Ax - b = 0 showed true. Which the
% Column Correspondence Property we can also assume that: Because Ax - c = 0:
% implies Sx - c = 0 which was shown true.
% Question 1 (c)
u = [-S(:,4); 1; 0], v = [-S(:,5);0;1]
% Question 1 (c) i
% A has two free variables, and three basic variables. Generating a vector by
% negating the basic variables and putting arbitrary numbers for the free variables
% creates new vectors within the span of A.
S*u
A*u
S*v
A*v
s = rand(1)
t = rand(1)
y = (s*u)+(t*v)
% Question 1 (c) ii
A*y
% Ay = 0 | y = su+tv 
% A(su+tv) = 0
% Property (a): A(u+v) = Au+Av => A(su+tv) = A(su)+A(tv)
% A(su)+A(tv) = 0
% Question 1 (d)
z = x + y
A*z-b
% z = x+y
% 1.3 (a): A(u+v) = Au+Av
% Az = A(x+y) = Ax+Ay
% Ax+Ay = b
% Proven that Ay = 0 previously
% Ax+0 = b
% Ax = b
% Ax-b = 0
% Question 2
u1 = rvect(3)
u2 = rvect(3)
u3 = rvect(3)
u4 = rvect(3)
% Question 2(a)
A = [u1 u2 u3]
rref(A)
% Question 2(a) i
% There are no free variables
% Question 2(a) ii
% It is linearly independent, there are no free variables, and the
% matrix is consistent for all values
% Question 2(b)
B = [u1 u2 u3 u4]
rref(B)
% Question 2(b) i
% There is 1 free variable, x4
% Question 2(b) ii
% B is linearly dependent since there is a free variable, where a scalar
% c can be a non-trivial solution
% Question 2(c)
v = rand(1)*u1 + rand(1)*u2
% C is linearly dependent, v is a linear combination of the vectors
% in C which will result in a free variable
C = [u1 u2 v]
rref(C)
% Question 3
A = rmat(2,3)
B = rmat(3, 4)
C = rmat(4,3)
v = rvect(4)
% Question 3 (a)
u = B*v
A*u
D = A*B
D*v
% Question 3 (b)
A = [0 1; 0 0]
B = [0 0; 1 0]
C = [0 1; 1 0]
% Question 3 (b) i
A*B
B*A
% AB != BA
(A+B)*(A+B)
(A*A)+((2*A)*(B))+(B*B)
% (A+B)^2 != A^2+2AB+B^2
% Question 3 (b) ii
A*A
% A^2 if it was a number would be that number multiplied by itself
% For matrices this pattern doesn't hold.
% Question 3 (b) iii
A*C
A*B
% I would conclude that B = C since they both result in the same answer
% This isn't true with matrices, matrix multiplication is different
% Question 4
A = [0 0 0 1 0 1;1 0 1 1 0 0;0 1 0 1 0 0;1 0 1 0 0 0;1 1 1 0 0 1;0 0 1 1 0 0]
% Question 4 i
% Image Provided.
% Question 4 ii
% Yes, the following:
% P1 can't receive from: P3, P6
% P2 can't receive from: P1, P4, P6
% P3 can't receive from: P1
% P4 can't receive from: P5
% P5 can't receive from: P1, P2, P3, P4, P6
% P6 can't receive from: P2, P3, P4
% Lines from the graph show this.
% Looking at the row number of the corresponding node name, then finding a '1' in a column
% which corresponds to a different node shows the same thing.
% Question 4 iii
A+A*A
A+A*A+A*A*A
A+A*A+A*A*A+A*A*A*A
% Using the adjacency matrix of A+A*A... provides an easy way to see what happens at
% each stage by looking at the (i,j) entry: (1,4) to be specific.
% Stage 1: P1 has one way, and cumulatively one way of sending a message to P4
% Stage 2: P1 has one way, and cumulatively two ways of sending a message to P4
% Stage 3: P1 has three ways, and cumulatively five ways of sending a message to P4
% Stage 4: P1 has five ways, and cumulatively ten ways of sending a message to P4
% Question 4 iv
B = (A)+(A*A)+(A*A*A)+(A*A*A*A)
% By looking at the (3,4) entry of B we can determine the following:
% P3 has cumulatively twelve ways of sending a message to P4
