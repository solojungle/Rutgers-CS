In general, consider the questions
- What aren't we testing?
- What are we testing?
- How are we testing it?

1) Opening Files
  What kind of files can you open?
  - Can open any kind of file.

2) Tokenizer
  What happens to control characters?
  - They eventually get translated into a friendlier char, which is decoded later to a control char.
  How many tokens can it handle?
  - As many as the computer memory can handle
  What kind of tokens can be tokenized?
  - Unicode

3) Building Codebook
  What is the maximum number of nodes to be created?
  - We realloc memory to fit as many nodes that the computer memory will allow,
  by checking on every insert.
  On NULL?
  - On NULL inputs the program will terminate, do to an error somewhere else in the program.
  What about random order of frequencies?
  - Min-heap is suffieciently built to handle all permutations of frequencies
  What happens when there is only one token?
  - Token will be 0

4) Decompression
  What is the maximum file size that can be decompressed?
  - Anything memory can handle
  What happens to control characters?
  - Succesfully translated back into original state

5) Recursion
  - Currently not implemented in this project

6) Outputting Files
  What if the file doesn't exist?
  - Program will create a new file
