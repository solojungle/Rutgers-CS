    Test E

        Supplies an edge test case, where user requests memory and we have enough memory in a block for the user,
    but not enough memory to make a new metadata block: we accept that request
    and supply the user with more than requested memory. Tested 100 times for consistency.

    Test F

        Revolves around testing the defragmentation function for consistency. We split array into four pieces:
    [1, 1, 1, 1], and free the middle two chunks of memory, [1, 0, 0, 1]. Run defragmentation in order to achieve
    [1, 0, 1]. Reallocate the middle node [1, 1, 1], free all the nodes [..., 0, ...] and then fill memory [..., 1, ...].
    Tested 100 times for consistency.
